Info - I own a lot of Books and Graphic Novels, all of which I have never catalogued. So why not create a little piece of software to help me do this? Well this is the first installment of Cataloguer; a small piece of software which aids in cataloguing a collection of Books, Novels, Comics, Graphic Novels etc... and saves it all in a small unformatted '.txt' file, for easy use in other applications. Associated file name is specified by the user through the menu features.

Usage - Just fill in all the fields from 'Name', all the way through to 'Issues Owned' then click save to save that single entry, then click 'Clear' and re-fill all the fields for the next Book, Comic etc...

This is just my first installment, as I will be upgrading it's features daily

-Update 21/04/2016 - Added a File menu with a 'New' tab to create a new txt file, which also links with the Save button so each entry can be added to the created and specified file. Also added a 'Help' tab for a brief instructions on how to use the software.

-Update 22/04/2016 - Created both 'Open' and 'New' functionality inside the File menu. Applied code to both 'New' and 'Open' which presents the user with a folder/file viewer for them to navigate and save or open the specified catalogue file in a path of their choosing. Reworked the 'Save' button functionality, which writes to the specified file on the specified path. 'Save' button also checks if the '.txt' notation has been added to the end of the filename, if not the this will be added automatically.
